    <h3>Batman History</h3>
    <p>
        his father's name is called thomas wayne.
        And his mother's name is bruce.
        The origin of Batman depicts the events that cause a young Bruce Wayne to become Batman. 
        The core event (the murder of Thomas and Martha Wayne by Joe Chill) has remained fairly unchanged, but the aftermath and Bruce's journey to become Batman were not detailed until later years. 
        The story first appeared in Detective Comics #33 (November, 1939), and was retold in graphic novels such as batman year one.
        Batman's origin is later expanded upon in Batman #47. 
        Bruce Wayne is born to Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha, two very wealthy and charitable Gotham City socialites. 
        Bruce is brought up in Wayne Manor, and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight, when his parents are killed by a small-time criminal named Joe Chill while on their way home from a movie theater. 
        That night, Bruce Wayne swears an oath to spend his life fighting crime. 
        He engages in intense intellectual and physical training; however, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. 
        "Criminals are a superstitious cowardly lot", Wayne remarks, "so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. 
        I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible ..." As if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to craft the Batman person.

    <h3>Robin: Richard John Grayson</h3>
    <p>
    Ra's al Ghul was a mentor and trainer to Bruce Wayne under the name Henri Ducard and recruited him into the League of Shadows to destroy Gotham City. 
        Bruce defied the organization, dismantled his allies in the Gotham Underworld, and put a stop to Ra's himself.
        Robin is the alias of several fictional superheroes appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. 
        The character was originally created by Bob Kane, Bill Finger, and Jerry Robinson, to serve as a junior counterpart to the superhero Batman. 
        The character's first incarnation, Dick Grayson, debuted in Detective Comics #38 (April 1940). 
        Conceived as a way to attract young readership, Robin garnered overwhelmingly positive critical reception, doubling the sales of the Batman titles. 
        The early adventures of Robin included Star Spangled Comics #65–130 (1947–1952), which was the character's first solo feature. 
        Robin made regular appearances in Batman related comic books and other DC Comics publications from 1940 through the early 1980s until the character set aside the Robin identity and became the independent superhero Nightwing. 
        The team of Batman and Robin has commonly been referred to as the Caped Crusaders or Dynamic Duo
        About a year after Batman's debut, Batman creators Bob Kane and Bill Finger introduced Robin the Boy Wonder in Detective Comics #38 (1940). 
        The name "Robin the Boy Wonder" and the medieval look of the original costume were inspired by Robin Hood. 
        Jerry Robinson noted he "came up with Robin because the adventures of Robin Hood were boyhood favorites of mine. 
        I had been given a Robin Hood book illustrated by N. C. Wyeth and that's what I quickly sketched out when I suggested the name Robin Hood, which they seemed to like, and then showed them the costume. 
        And if you look at it, it's Wyeth's costume, from my memory, because I didn't have the book to look at.

    <h3>Jason Peter Todd</h3>
    <p> 
        Initially sharing a similar origin to Grayson, subsequent portrayals commonly depict Todd as an orphaned street delinquent, whom Batman attempts to reform and mentors rigorously.
        Though initially popular while he was Robin, the character as written by Jim Starlin was not well received by fans following the revamping of his origin by Max Allan Collins in Batman #408–409. 
        This negative reception led to DC Comics holding a telephone poll in 1988's "A Death in the Family" storyline to determine whether or not the character would die at the hands of the Joker, Batman's nemesis. 
        The poll ended with a narrow majority of votes in favor of killing Todd, resulting in his death. 
        Subsequent Batman stories dealt with Batman's guilt over not having been able to save him. 
        Todd was resurrected in 2005's "Under the Hood" story arc and became the new Red Hood, an antihero with a willingness to use lethal force and weapons. 
        Since his return, he operates as the Red Hood in current DC Comics continuity.    
        By the time Len Wein took over as editor of DC Comics' Batman titles in 1982, Dick Grayson had largely moved on to starring as the leader of the young superhero team the Teen Titans in DC's New Teen Titans title. 
        However, with the character no longer featured in Batman comics, the disadvantages of telling Batman stories without the character to act as a sounding board for the protagonist became apparent.
        Jason Todd was created as Dick Grayson's replacement as Robin. 
        The character debuted in Batman #357 (March 1983) and made his first full appearance in Detective Comics #525 (April 1983), but it wasn't until later that year when he would appear in costume as Robin in Batman #366 (Dec 1983) when he showed up towards the end of the story to help Batman fight the Joker.
        Following the 1985 limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC took the opportunity to reboot many of its properties. 
        The character was completely revamped. According to Dennis O'Neil, who took over as Batman editor in 1986, "[The fans] did hate him. I don't know if it was fan craziness—maybe they saw him as usurping Dick Grayson's position. 
        Some of the mail response indicated that this was at least on some people's minds."
